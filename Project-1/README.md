<a name="br1"></a>**CSE358/CSE5058 Artificial Intelligence Project 1**

**Project Definition**

In this project, you are required to determine the shortest path between two cities using the Uniform Cost Search
(UCS) algorithm. Figure 1 illustrates the road map provided for this assignment.

*Figure 1. A simplified road map of some Turkish cities.*

**To-Do**

You are going to develop a Python application, which is expected to meet the following requirements:

**R1.** The road map should be initialized from a csv file.

**R2.** The user should be able to specify the path of the road map file.
**R3.** The user should be able to specify the start (current city). **R4.** The user should be able to specify the end (target city).

**R5.** The application should present the shortest path and the distance between the start and end.

**R6.** The application should be robust and able to handle exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError and CityNotFoundError)
